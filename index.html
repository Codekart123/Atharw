                <h2>DIRECTOR'S MESSAGE</h2>

                <h5>
                    <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">A</span>tharw is one of the initiatives of CodeKart. It is the
                    edu-tech platform for providing the finest
                    education based upon
                    both technical as well as non-technical domains. The name Atharw has come from one of our Veda i.e.
                    Atharva Veda in
                    which the procedures of day to day life is clearly mentioned. The core values of Atharw has come
                    from Bhagavad Gita i.e.
                    'Purity', 'Honesty' & 'Dedication'. Being the members of Atharw, we are proud to follow our core
                    values which always
                    motivate us to spread purity through our contents, honestly treat our students and give our 100%
                    dedication which will
                    reflect on our student's career.
                    <br><br>
                    When students are going to take any of the courses from any platform one thing comes to their mind
                    is whether that
                    course or training is helpful for their career or not and can they get good opportunities to achieve
                    their goal. In the
                    teenage years or after graduation the state of mind of the students are always variable. They can
                    not decide which
                    career path they have to choose and which path gives them the satisfaction. As a result they join
                    any field and after
                    some years they get frustrated. In Atharw we don't tell students to join this training, it will make
                    your career good or
                    choose that training that will give you a high package. We first keep ourselves in their place, try
                    to understand their
                    area of interest, their dedication level and their aim of life and then we show them the
                    possibilities and path to get
                    their ultimate goal.
                    <br><br>
                    In the initial days we have started from varieties of technical training which can make the
                    students
                    industry ready as
                    per the current scenario. Very soon we are going to help students of non-technical background
                    who
                    are preparing for
                    non-technical jobs, students of schools and colleges. Our main motto is to provide quality
                    education
                    with the help of
                    technology because we believe that "Technology with education is for everyone"
